Description: Estimate causal effects of one variable on another, currently for
  binary data only. Methods include instrumental variable bounds, adjustment by a 
  given covariate set, adjustment by an induced covariate set using a variation of 
  the PC algorithm, and an effect bounding method (the Witness Protection Program) 
  based on covariate adjustment with observable independence constraints.
